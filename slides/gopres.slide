* Liam Introduction


* What is Go?
- Open-Source programming language developed by Google
- Inspired by `C` and `Python`
- Statically Typed
- Benefits include fast startup time, low runtime overhead, and the ability to run without a Virtual Machine (VM)
- Versatile language that can be applied to many different Usecases

* Companies Using Go

* Common Usecases
- Cloud and Network Services
- Command-line Interfaces (CLIs)
- Web Development
- Development Operations & Site Reliability Engineering
.link https://go.dev/solutions/#use-cases Go's Documentation on Use Cases

* Another Usecase: Giving Presentations
I am leveraging the [[https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/present][Go Present]] package for this presentation.

I did this because I wanted to: 

- To show the versaility of Go.
- Be able to run code snippets within the presentation.
- Strengthen my understanding of Go and Markdown.
- Have a hosted version of this presentation for viewing now and in the future.


(Downside being that theming is a little more complicated, so apologies for the vanilla slides...)

* Defer, Panic, and Recover

* Defer

* Defer Definition
- `defer` enables us to prevent the execution of a funtion until a later time.
- Doesn't run a function, it runs a *function* *call*.
- Follows last in, first out (LIFO) order. In other words, the last `defer` statement that is called will be the first to be executed. 

* Defer Example
.play ../code/IdiomaticGo/Defer/D2/defer02.go

* Defer Example: Continued
.play ../code/IdiomaticGo/Defer/D3/defer03.go

* Defer Example: Cleanup Operations on File Creation
.play ../code/IdiomaticGo/Defer/D1/defer01.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Panic

* Panic Definition
- `panic` stops the control flow of our program.
- We use `panic` when our application enters a state that is cannot recover from.
- `panic` calls happen after a _deferred_ statment is executed.
- The program ends after the `panic` statement is run.

* Calling the Panic Function Directly
.play ../code/IdiomaticGo/Panic/P1/panic01.go

* Raising a Panic
.play ../code/IdiomaticGo/Panic/P2/panic02.go

* Panic and Defer Relationship
.play ../code/IdiomaticGo/Panic/P4/panic04.go

* Resulting Panics from Illegal Conditions
.play ../code/IdiomaticGo/Panic/P3/panic03.go

* Recover

* Recover Definition
- `recover` is used to recover from a `panic` .
- It is only used inside of *deferred* funtions. This is because the deferred function does not stop its execution if the program panics, so the `recover` function stops the panicking when the deferred function is called.
- If we `panic`, we can choose how to `recover` within the `defer` -red logic that we know will run if there is a panic in the first place. 

* Divide Function Improved

.play ../code/BeyondTheBasics/Testing/testing01.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Concurrency with Go Routines

* What is Concurrency?
- The ability for functions to run independently of each other.
- Very important in modern software due to the need to execute independent pieces of code as fast as possible without disturbing the overall flow of the program.
- Go makes this concept very easy to achieve through the use of Go Routines and Wait Groups.

* Go Routines and Wait Groups
- To kick off a goroutine, simply use the `go` keyword. I.e. "go do this thing now while we continue on here"
- _Wait_Groups_ can be leveraged to control the parent process to "wait" until all of the other goroutines have completed. 

* Go Routine Without Wait Group
